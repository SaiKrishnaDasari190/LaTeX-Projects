# Basic LaTeX Projects

These are the basic Documents that i have done using LaTeX in TeX Maker

The Documents Consists of Hyperlinks, Figure references and table of contents with clickable links those can not be evaluated by the opening the document in GibHub.

Instead Download the PDF file into the device and open the document in any PDF Viewer (i.e. Adobe Reader, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome etc...) for better experience. You can go through all features of the documents and you'll feel the real essence of any LaTeX document :) ....
