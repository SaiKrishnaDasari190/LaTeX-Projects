# Basic LaTeX Projects

These are the basic Documents that i have done using LaTeX in TeX Maker

The Documents Consists of Hyperlinks and table of contents with links those can not be evaluated by the opening the document in GibHub.

Instead Dowload the PDF file into the device and open the document in any PDF Viewer (i.e. Adobe Reader, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome etc... for better experience and can go through the all the features of the documents and you can feel the real essence of any LaTeX document :) ....
