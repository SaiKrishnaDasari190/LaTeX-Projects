# LaTeX-Projects
The Documents are created using LaTeX in TeX Maker. 

Each Folder consists of The Output Document File(i.e Document in PDF Format) and a TeX File (i.e. the template CODE of the Document)

__Document:__ The Document can consists of Title page(with logos and authors and website links), table of contents(Clickable Links(it can redirect to the topic)), Images/Figures(we can refer the figures/images from any where in the document), Tables, Mathematical Equations, References(Bibilography) etc...


__TeX File:__ The TeX File consists of all the syntax/source code of the Document that can be further modified in any TeX editors like TeX Maker, Online Leaf etc...
